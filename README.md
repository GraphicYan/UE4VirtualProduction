# An example of Virtual Production in Unreal Engine 

This example shows how to create a Virtual set, where live video of your "talent" (actors) is combined with a virtual set that is rendered in realtime by unreal.  There tracked you can move or handhold and a big cartoon hammer that follows another tracker on a selfi stick.  Other features include a way to locate where you want your real world "talent" to appear in the level and a garbage matte to prevent the camera from picking up things not in front of the greenscreen.

The example only uses the 3rd person starter project assets so it is small and easy to download.  You can migrate the assets from this project into any other map so you can use an unreal sample level or your own creation as a virtual set.

# Tutorial video is on Youtube

Instead of a printed guide I put a video up on youtube, you can find it on my channel https://www.youtube.com/user/GregCorson along with other demo videos.  There are also some playlists with a lot of Virtual Production and mixed reality videos from other creators.

This may look complicated but you can get some great results from a very simple setup and since everything here runs in real-time, you can even use this setup for livestreaming!

# Problems with Unreal 4.24.1 and steam 1.10.1

There are some new setup requirements for UE 4.24.1 and some problems with Steam 1.10.1

See "readme_2" in this github for details on how to set things up.  This is still in progress because Steam was just updated and the issues are still being worked out.  The current repository SHOULD work with UE 4.24.1 and steam 1.9.16 (the current "release" non beta).  If you want to stay on UE 4.23.1 use one of the older versions.
