# An example of Virtual Production in Unreal Engine 

This example shows how to create a Virtual set, where live video of your "talent" (actors) is combined with a virtual set that is rendered in realtime by unreal.  There tracked you can move or handhold and a big cartoon hammer that follows another tracker on a selfi stick.  Other features include a way to locate where you want your real world "talent" to appear in the level and a garbage matte to prevent the camera from picking up things not in front of the greenscreen.

The example only uses the 3rd person starter project assets so it is small and easy to download.  You can migrate the assets from this project into any other map so you can use an unreal sample level or your own creation as a virtual set.

# DOCUMENTATION IS COMING

I am writing a guide for how to setup the whole Virtual Production studio.  I'd suggest you wait for that guide before buying anything unless you are experienced with Unreal.  You can see examples on my YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/user/GregCorson The full setup for this project was a Vive PRO VR setup, two VIVE tracking pucks, a camera, a green-screen and an AJA Kona-HDMI video capture card.  But don't panic! You don't have to have all this stuff, you can do quite a lot with just a cheap webcam!  You can also modify the project to use other VR tracking gear you might already have.

This may look complicated but you can get some great results from a very simple setup and since everything her runs in real-time, you can even use this setup for livestreaming!
