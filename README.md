# Virtual Production Projects For Unreal Engine

Virtual Production puts real people in a CG background, adds CG people/objects to live video scenes and a lot of other things.  Cameras can move and the CG backgrounds can be animated.  It is being used in a lot of TV and Movies like Disney's "The Mandalorian"  This repository will help you get started using Epic's free Unreal Engine to do Virtual Production yourself.

Below is me doing a product review from a Virtual Set.  The output is real-time so you can live stream to YouTube or a video conferencing app like Zoom or Microsoft Teams. Only me and the desk are real, everything else is CG.   You can see more examples on [my youtube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/user/GregCorson)

# Getting Started

Everyone has a different hardware and studio so none of these projects are "plug-and-play" you will need to customize them a bit to work with the hardware you have.  There are tutorials on [my youtube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/user/GregCorson) to help you get started.  If you have never used Unreal Engine before you should probably watch a couple of the getting started courses on the [Unreal Engine Learning Hub](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/onlinelearning-courses) to get familiar with how to use Unreal.

My samples were done using consumer DSLR cameras and VIVE VR gear for tracking.  They can be customized for pro quality cameras and camera tracking equipment or can be used with something as simple/cheap as a webcam.  Any good 3d gaming PC will work for this.

You will need a free download of [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/) to run these samples.

# In This Repository

* VPStudio -- my Virtual Production sample.  All the newer tutorials and samples come from this.
* UE4VirtualProduction -- not maintained any more I recommend using VPStudio for new work.
* TrackerTest -- a project that measures tracker jitter and reports it so you can tune your setup for lowest jitter

# Goals of this project

Virtual Production is still very new and there isn't much documentation about how to set it up and use it.  New features are coming out so quickly that the "official" documentation hasn't caught up yet. I'm working out how to do Virtual Production and am making my projects and tutorials available so more people can use it for things like YouTube content and their own movies.

# Other Sources of help

There is a lot of virtual production info on social media, check #virtualproduction to find the latest ones.  For good help from experienced people chec this [discord channel] (https://discord.com/invite/ReEhkhc) and this [facebook group] (https://www.facebook.com/groups/virtualproduction)

# Some other applications

Virtual Production can be used to take people from in different places and put them all together on a virtual set, great for press conferences, product announcements and training videos.  Unreal Engine can also be used to produce high quality animated productions like [this] (https://youtu.be/6xbxA8tnlbY) or [this] (https://youtu.be/cE0wfjsybIQ) very quickly.

The great thing about Unreal Engine virtual production is that the same tools can be used in a small home studio or in huge big budget movie productions.

# Free software and 3d models

My examples and the software and CG assets I used to make them are available for free.  Almost everything I have used in my demos comes from the "free assets" section of Unreal Marketplace.  There is a lot of CG content available there and every month they release more.  Unfortunately, Unreal's licensing doesn't allow me to redistribute this content here, but you can grab it yourself from the marketplace and add them to my VPStudio project by following the [Use your own sets tutorial] [https://youtu.be/trlpmm5gI6U] on my YouTube channel.

# Please Contribute!

These projects will help you get started.  You can use them for any purpose.  If you use it to produce a video or want to redistribute a project based on this, please credit me and include links back to my Youtube channel.  Let me know what you post and I will reference your work on my sites too!

I'm hoping this will get enough people started in Virtual Production to increase the amount of information about it and make it easier for even more people to join in!
